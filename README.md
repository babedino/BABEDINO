## ⚠️ Whitelist Flag Clarification

Some scanner platforms may still show a "Whitelist" warning.

➡️ **This is incorrect.**  
The whitelist function is permanently disabled via renounced ownership.

**Technical facts:**
- `whitelistEndTime = 0`, permanently disabling the whitelist logic.
- No wallet ever received tax exemption, priority access, or transaction bypass.
- Ownership is renounced and whitelist logic is permanently unreachable.

See full justification in this official safety document:  
📄 [BABEDINO_Whitelist_Disabled.pdf](docs/BABEDINO_Whitelist_Disabled.pdf)

**Manual steps to verify:**
1. Open the token contract on BscScan
2. Navigate to the "Read Contract" tab
3. Locate `isWhitelisted(address)`
4. Enter any address (e.g., `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`)
5. Result: `false`
